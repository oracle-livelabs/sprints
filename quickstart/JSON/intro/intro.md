# Introduction

## About this LiveLabs QuickStart

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the go-to format for modern data exchange. It’s lightweight, human-readable, and works seamlessly across virtually every programming language. But why is it so popular? The answer lies in its simplicity and flexibility. JSON has become the backbone of APIs, configurations, and semi-structured data in today's applications, offering an ideal way to manage complex data in a clear, organized manner.

In the fast-paced world of application development, the need to handle dynamic, hierarchical data is more important than ever. Relational databases, with their rigid tables, often struggle to capture the nuance of such data. Enter JSON: the perfect solution for developers dealing with data that doesn’t fit neatly into a table. But what if you could have the best of both worlds? That's where Oracle Database 23ai comes in.

This QuickStart will introduce you to JSON Relational Duality, a powerful feature that allows you to store data in relational tables while accessing it as JSON documents — or the other way around. Imagine having the performance and consistency of relational databases, combined with the flexibility of JSON, all within a single, unified system. Let's explore how this game-changing feature can simplify your development process and take your data management to the next level.
