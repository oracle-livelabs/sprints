# Introduction  

Welcome to this **FastStart** workshop.  

**FastStart workshops** are designed to provide you with clear, step-by-step instructions that help you to quickly gain hands-on experience using the **Oracle AI Database**.  
This workshop type equips you with the information you need, to **move from zero to hero in a short amount of time**.

Each FastStart workshop **includes Get Started Labs** that guide you through the steps required to launch your **free lab environment**.  
While the concepts in these workshops apply equally to Oracle AI Database on-premises and in the cloud, the labs demonstrate how to get started using an **Autonomous AI Database**.

<u>The **Get Started** lab instructions provide you with two options for launching your Autonomous AI Database lab environment:</u>

* ***Oracle Cloud Always Free Autonomous AI Database lab environment***
* ***Local Oracle Autonomous AI Database Container lab environment***  

    <u>**Each option includes detailed steps to:**</u>

    * Create the database lab environment
    * Create an Autonomous AI Database instance
    * Connect to Autonomous AI Database instance
    * Open the Database Actions launchpad, for access to built-in development tools.  

    ***This ensures you are ready to follow your step by step lab instructions.***

### ***About Oracle AI Database:***
Oracle AI Database is the next long-term support release of Oracle Database.  
It includes over 300 new features with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and developer productivity.  

<u>**Key highlights include:**</u>

* **AI Vector Search:** Enable you to leverage a new generation of AI models to generate and store vectors of documents, images, or sound; index them;  
and be able to perform fast similarity searches while leveraging the existing analytical capabilities of Oracle AI Database.
* **Machine Learning integrations:** Enables users to use the extensive set of built-in algorithms, to quickly create AI-enabled applications.
* **AI-driven optimizations:** Oracle AI Database also uses AI to optimize many of the key database functions to make more accurate estimates on timings and resource costings.  

<u>**New developer-focused features now make it simpler to build next-generation applications:**</u>

* Simplified JSON and relational development with JSON Relationla Duality Views, allows you to use both interchangeably.
* Expanded microservices and messaging capabilities further improve upon Oracle Database's extensive support for this key design methodology.
* Addition of RAFT protocol support for sharding and distributed deployments makes it easy to meet regulatory or performance requirements.  

<u>**SQL and PL/SQL enhancements:**</u>

* New data types and language features for OLTP and analytics.
* SQL Firewall for fine-grained SQL execution, to enble you to control exactly what SQL is executed against your database.  

<u>**Performance and management advances:**</u>

* Many of the key dba management tasks have been refined to reduce their complexity and improving their performance
* New functionality to simplify dba tasks have been added, such as tools to reclaim free space and reduce DBA overhead
* Oracle AI Database also adds performance boosts at both the infrastructure level (e.g., True Cache) and SQL level, ensuring some statements will execute many times faster.

### ***What is an Autonomous AI Database?***
Oracle's ***Autonomous AI Database*** is a cloud database that uses machine learning to automate critical operations, including tuning, security, backups, and updates.  
Unlike a conventional database, it handles these tasks without human intervention.

You do not need to plan storage layouts, schedule backups, or tune queries. Oracle automates all of it, so you can focus on your data and applications.

<u>When you create an Autonomous Database, you can deploy it to one of three kinds of Exadata infrastructure:</u>

* **Dedicated Exadata Cloud Infrastructure (Dedicated)** – Your own isolated Exadata cloud environment.
* **Serverless Exadata Cloud Infrastructure (Shared/Serverless)** – A multi-tenant service where Oracle manages everything.
* **Exadata Cloud@Customer** – Exadata infrastructure deployed inside your data center, managed by Oracle.


Oracle’s Autonomous Database is the perfect fast-start service for fast data loading, sophisticated data reporting, and running advanced analytics.  
Oracle manages everything for you, so that you can accelerate application development without worrying about database administration.
