# Introduction

Welcome to this **LiveLabs FastStart** .

LiveLabs FastStarts give you clear, step-by-step instructions to get hands-on with the Oracle AI Database quickly.
This FastStart gives you what you need to go from setup to first success—fast.

## Who this is for

- Application developers building AI-enabled apps (JSON Duality, vectors, microservices)

- Data scientists/analysts exploring AI Vector Search and in-database ML

- DBAs/architects evaluating manageability, security (SQL Firewall), and performance

## What is an Autonomous AI Database?

Oracle’s Autonomous AI Database (ADB) is a cloud database that uses AI to automate critical operations—tuning, security, backups, and updates—without human intervention. You focus on data and apps; Oracle runs the database.

When you create an Autonomous AI Database, you can deploy it on:

- Autonomous AI Database on Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure (Dedicated) — your own isolated Exadata cloud environment
- Autonomous AI Database Serverless (shared Exadata infrastructure) — a multi-tenant service fully operated by Oracle
- Exadata Cloud@Customer — Exadata infrastructure in your data center, managed by Oracle
- Autonomous AI Database Container Image - For testing, you can also deploy a container image using Docker or Podman.

ADB is a great fit for rapid data loading, sophisticated reporting, and advanced analytics. Oracle’s service automation helps you accelerate development without traditional DBA overhead.

## FastStart Prerequisites

- Access to an Autonomous AI Database

  - If using Oracle Cloud (Always Free): Oracle Cloud account with permission to create an Autonomous Database in your tenancy/region
    - [Autonomous Database 15 Minute Quick Start](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=133:180:4579534958655::::wid:928)

  - If using the local container: A compatible container runtime (e.g., Docker/Podman) and sufficient local CPU/RAM/disk to run the database container
    - [Use the Autonomous Database Free Container Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/autonomous-database-serverless/doc/autonomous-database-container-free.html)
