# Introduction

## About this Demo

**JSON Relational Duality** lets apps think in JSON while Oracle stores the same data relationally; no copies, no drift, and full SQL power. You work with one business object as JSON (for speed and developer ergonomics), and the database keeps a normalized schema behind the scenes (for integrity, analytics, and scale).

You get one source of truth with multiple access paths, JSON APIs, REST, MongoDB-compatible API, and SQL—plus enterprise features like security, backup/recovery, and governance.

### What You’ll Discover:

- **Create a Duality View**: Turn a relational model into an updatable JSON view, edit JSON, and the relational tables update automatically.
- **Insert a Record**: Add a customer (as JSON) and see it appear in the simulated tables.
- **Generate a Report**: Run a query to list active customers and the sum of their orders; all directly over JSON via SQL.
- **Modify & Delete**: Update data with optimistic concurrency (ETag concept) and see consistent results across JSON and relational views. 


### Key Benefits:
- **One model, zero duplication**: No fragile copies or ETL spaghetti, allowing apps and analytics to use the same live data.
- **SQL and JSON together**: Build fast with JSON, analyze deep with SQL without moving data around.
- **Fewer moving parts**: Less middleware, fewer sync jobs, and lower risk.
- **Enterprise safety net**: Governance, auditing, backup/recovery, the usual Oracle strengths apply to your JSON as well.
-  **Works everywhere**: On-prem (Exadata/ODA), OCI (Autonomous DB, Exadata DB Service, Base DB Service), and multicloud (Oracle Database @ Azure/Google Cloud/AWS), plus Always Free and downloadable images
