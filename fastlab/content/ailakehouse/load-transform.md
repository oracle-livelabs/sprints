# 🏗️ Build a Live Feed Data Pipeline: Load and Transform Data

## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll practice setting up the live feed capabilities, that can be used to load data that is continuously collected into cloud object storage. <br>
When a load job is enabled for live feed, it can be a scheduled job or connected to the OCI event notification and subscription mechanism, so that every time a new object is created in the object store bucket, it triggers the live feed, that can then transform & load the content into the database.  

In this lab we will help our Seer Equities loan officers to keep a fresh supply of loan products by building an automated data pipeline that takes in loan funding commitment files from investors in JSON format and transforms and loads the data into a staging table in the database, where a nightly job will run to convert the new funding into Loan Products that the loan officers can sell.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

Leverage Autonomous AI Lakehouse Data Studio Tools to Build a Live Feed Data Pipeline
 * Configure Object Storage location for Data Pipeline interaction
 * Create a Live Feed table in Autonomous Database
 * Simulate how new data loaded into object storage triggers Live Feed automation

### Prerequisites

  This lab assumes you have:
  * **Completed Lab 1 --> Task 1 and 2** which creates the catalog connection to the public object storage bucket named **LOANAPP\_LAB\_FILES**

## Task 1: Prepare to Build a Live Feed Data Pipeline: 

  1. Let's start by creating a Private Oracle Object Storage Bucket called **MY\_DEMO\_BUCKET** with a directory called **FUNDING** to store your data.
  
  2. Navigate back to the Oracle Cloud Console at ***cloud.oracle.com***

  3. Open the **Navigation Menu** by clicking the hamburger icon in the top-left corner of the Oracle Cloud console 
  
    - Then click on **Storage** link
    - Then click on **Buckets** link, Under **Object Storage & Archive Storage**

    ![Create Bucket – Navigate to Storage Buckets](./images/create-bucket-navigate-to-storage-buckets.png "=50%x*")
  
  4. On the **Buckets** page, select the compartment where you want to create the bucket and ensure that you are in the region where you want to create your bucket.

    ![Create Bucket – Select Compartment and Region](./images/create-bucket-select-compartment-and-region.png "=50%x*")
  
  5. Click on **Create Bucket** to proceed.
  
  6. On the **Create Bucket** page, specify the following:
      - For **Bucket Name:** Enter **MY\_DEMO\_BUCKET**.
      - For **Default Storage Tier:** Accept the default value of **Standard**. 
      - For **Encryption:** Accept the default value of **Encrypt using Oracle managed keys**.
  
      >**Note:** Bucket names must be unique per tenancy and region.

      ![Create Bucket – Enter Bucket Details](./images/create-bucket-enter-bucket-details.png "=50%x*")
  
      - Click on **Create** button to proceed with creating the object storage bucket.
  
  7. The new bucket will now be displayed on your **Buckets** page. Note that the default bucket visibility type is **Private**.
  
      ![The new bucket is displayed on the Buckets page.](./images/create-bucket-done.png " ")

  8. Update the bucket visibility to Public

      -Click on **Actions Icon**  on far right of row with your bucket name
      -Then select **Edit Visibility**

      ![Make Bucket Public](./images/make-bucket-public.png " ")

      -Select **Public** Radial Button and Click on **Update** Button

      ![Make Bucket Public ](./images/make-bucket-public-2.png " ")

## Task 5: Test Live Feed Automatic Table Data Population

  >This process will help our friends at Seer Equities to be able to automate receiving loan funding from investors and staging that data for conversion into Loan Products that their Loan Officers can then sell.  
  Now that our datapipeline is built let's simulate another investor submitting loan funding capital by uploading the **funding_commitments2.json** file into the **FUNDING** folder under MY\_DEMO\_BUCKET and ensuring that it is automatically analyzed and staged for processing. **Note:** that this file contains 4 rows.

1. Upload the **funding_commitments2.json** file into the **FUNDING** folder under **MY\_DEMO\_BUCKET**

    -***Switch back to Buckets Tab*** from Task 1 and  click on **MY\_DEMO\_BUCKET**

    ![Select My Demo Bucket](./images/select-my-demo-bucket.png "")

    -Click on **Upload Objects** button

    ![Click Upload objects](./images/click-upload-objects.png "")

    -Upload **funding_commitments2.json** file into **FUNDING** Folder  
      * For **Object Name Prefix:** enter **FUNDING/**. This will place the file in the FUNDING folder in our bucket.  
      * For **Choose Files from your Computer:** select the **funding_commitments2.json** file you downloaded.  
      * Select **Next** button to proceed

    ![Upload funding_commitments2.json file](./images/upload-funding-commitments2.json.png "")

    -Click on **Upload Objects** button

    ![Upload funding_commitments1.json file](./images/upload-step2-funding-commitments2.json.png "")

    -Click on **Close** button to return to **Buckets** page


2. Validate that the new LiveFeed data was automatically loaded into the staging table

      ***Switch back to Database Actions Live Feed Tab***

     * Review the details for the Live Table Feed.  **Here we see that 4 new rows were loaded.**
     >Remember that it may take up to 2 minutes to display the new data, as we have configured a 2 minute polling schedule for our Live Feed process.  
     ***Set the refresh timer to 10 seconds*** on the Live Feed Page, to automatically display when new data has been processed.

     ![Review Live Feed Execution 2](./images/verify-live-feed-load-file2.png)

3. Let's also validate that the data was loaded into the database by **Opening the SQL worksheet tool** and quering the data pipeline staging table called **FUNDING\_PROVIDER\_OFFER\_STG**.

    -Click on **Database Actions** link in banner

    ![Click Database Action Link](./images/click-database-actions-link.png)
    
    -***Open SQL Worksheet tool*** by selecting **Development** then **SQL** and then the **Open** button

    ![Open SQL Worksheet Tool](./images/open-sql-worksheet.png)

    -Query the Live Feed Staging table by running the follwing in the SQL worksheet window

    ```text
        <copy>
        SELECT * FROM FUNDING_PROVIDER_OFFER_STG;
        </copy>
    ```

    ![Query Live Feed Staging Table](./images/query-live-feed-staging-table.png)

    -***Validate that you see 7 rows in the staging table.*** (3 rows from the 1st file we uploaded and 4 rows from the 2nd file).

***Congratulations!!!*** You have successfully created a Live Feed data pipeline, that can automatically load data from object storage into your database and be integrated into an automated business process.

## Conclusion

  ***Congratulations !!!*** You have successfully completed the FastLab on working with Autonomous AI Lakehouse to build an automated data pipeline!  

  <u>**In this lab you:**</u>

    -**created an automated live feed data pipeline.**  

  You also used some of the ***Autonomous AI Lakehouse*** **Database Actions** tools, such as:  
    -the **Autonomous AI Database Catalog** to gain visibility to data in object storage  
    -the **Data Load** tool to upload content into object storage  
    -and the **Live Feed** tool to build a scheduled data pipeleine
