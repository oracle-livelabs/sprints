# How to use Select AI in Oracle Autonomous AI Database

Welcome to this **LiveLabs FastLab** workshop.

LiveLabs FastLab workshops give you clear, step-by-step instructions to help you quickly gain hands-on experience with the Oracle Autonomous AI Database. You will go from beginner to confident user in a short time.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

## FastLab Introduction

In today's data-driven world, accessing and analyzing information quickly is crucial, especially in fields like healthcare where timely insights can save lives. However, writing SQL queries requires specialized skills that not all business users possess.

**Select AI** is Oracle's generative AI feature integrated into Autonomous Database that translates natural language questions into accurate SQL queries. It democratizes data access, allowing analysts, doctors, and managers to derive insights from databases using plain English, without needing to learn complex SQL syntax.

This capability is particularly important in healthcare, where non-technical staff can query patient records, treatment outcomes, or resource allocation to support faster decision-making and improve patient care. With Select AI, you can focus on the questions that matter, while the AI handles the technical details.

In this 15-minute lab, you'll create a sample healthcare dataset and use Select AI to generate and execute queries for common business cases.

### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Autonomous AI Database - If you do not have one, see:   
    [LiveLabs FastLab - Create an Autonomous Database. Fast!](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=4276)

- Select AI already configured for your database:
      - `EXECUTE` privilege on `DBMS_CLOUD_AI` for your lab user
      - An AI profile that:
         - Points to a supported LLM provider (for example OCI Generative AI or OpenAI)
         - Includes your schema in its `object_list` so Select AI can see the `PATIENTS` table

> If you have not configured Select AI yet, complete the Select AI setup first  
> (["How to Use Oracle Select AI: A Step-by-Step Guide (Generative AI)”](https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/how-to-use-oracle-select-ai-a-stepbystep-guide-generative-ai)) before this FastLab.


## Task 1: Launch Database Actions and SQL Worksheet

You will use Database Actions as your workspace. This task opens the SQL Worksheet so you can run SQL commands.

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, navigate to your Autonomous Database.

2. Click **Database Actions** and select **SQL**.

3. Verify that a profile exists
      ```sql
         <copy>
         SELECT profile_name, status
         FROM user_cloud_ai_profiles;
      </copy>
         ```

## Task 2: Create a Sample Healthcare Dataset

To demonstrate Select AI, we'll create a simple `patients` table with sample data representing patient records.

1. Run the following SQL to create the table and insert data:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    -- Create patients table
    CREATE TABLE patients (
        id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR2(100),
        age NUMBER,
        gender VARCHAR2(10),
        condition VARCHAR2(100),
        admission_date DATE
    );

    -- Insert sample data
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('John Doe', 65, 'Male', 'Diabetes', DATE '2024-01-15');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Jane Smith', 72, 'Female', 'Heart Disease', DATE '2024-03-20');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Bob Johnson', 55, 'Male', 'Hypertension', DATE '2024-05-10');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Alice Brown', 68, 'Female', 'Diabetes', DATE '2024-02-05');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Charlie Wilson', 80, 'Male', 'Heart Disease', DATE '2024-06-01');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Diana Davis', 45, 'Female', 'Asthma', DATE '2024-04-12');

    COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ```

2. Verify the data:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM patients;
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Access Select AI

You can use Select AI either from SQL (using the `SELECT AI` command) or from the Select AI chat UI in Database Actions.

1. From the Autonomous Database details page, click **Database Actions**.

2. In the Database Actions launchpad, do one of the following (depending on your environment):

   - **Option A – Use SQL Worksheet (recommended for this FastLab)**  
     Click **SQL** to open the SQL Worksheet. You will run `SELECT AI` statements directly in Task 4.

   - **Option B – Use the Select AI chat UI**  
     If your launchpad includes a **Select AI** or **Select AI chat** entry (often under **Development → Machine Learning → Oracle Machine Learning**), click it to open the chat interface.

3. Sign in with your database user if prompted.


## Task 4: Generate SQL Queries with Select AI for Healthcare Business Cases

Select AI analyzes your natural language and generates SQL based on your schema.  
Your SQL may not match the examples below exactly, but it should be logically equivalent and return the same rows.

   >If you are using the chat UI, type this question in the prompt box.

   >If you are using SQL Worksheet, run this as a SELECT AI statement.

Note: Behind the scenes, Select AI uses your AI profile to know which tables and columns it can use (for this lab, the `PATIENTS` table). 
It sends natural language plus table metadata to the LLM, gets back SQL, and then runs that SQL in your database.
   

1. **Business Case: Identify elderly patients with diabetes for follow-up care.**

   Enter in Select AI: "List all patients over 60 years old with diabetes."

   Example SQL generated by Select AI:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE age > 60 AND condition = 'Diabetes';
   ```

   - This query would return John Doe and Alice Brown.

2. **Business Case: Analyze admissions for heart conditions in the past 6 months.**

   Enter: “How many patients were admitted with heart disease in 2024?”

   Example SQL generated by Select AI:

   ```sql
      SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM   patients
   WHERE  condition = 'Heart Disease'
   AND    admission_date BETWEEN DATE '2024-01-01' AND DATE '2024-12-31';
   ```

   - This helps in resource planning for cardiology.

3. **Business Case: Gender distribution of patients with chronic conditions.**

   Enter: "Show the number of male and female patients with diabetes or heart disease."

   Example SQL generated by Select AI:

   ```sql
   SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM patients WHERE condition IN ('Diabetes', 'Heart Disease') GROUP BY gender;
   ```

   - Useful for demographic analysis in healthcare studies.

4. **Business Case: Recent admissions overview.**

   Enter: "List patients admitted after April 2024, sorted by admission date."

   Example SQL generated by Select AI:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE admission_date > DATE '2024-04-01' ORDER BY admission_date;
   ```

   - Aids in tracking recent cases.

For each query, Select AI will display the generated SQL. You can review, modify if needed, and execute it.

## Task 5: Optional – Tweak and run the generated SQL in SQL Worksheet

The Select AI chat UI can already execute the SQL it generates.

If you want to:
- Edit the SQL, or
- Save it as part of a script

you can copy it into the SQL Worksheet and run it there.

For example, copy this SQL and modify it:

```sql
      SELECT * 
      FROM   patients 
      WHERE  age > 60 
      AND    condition = 'Diabetes';
```

## Task 6: Ask your own questions

Now use Select AI to ask at least **three** of your own questions about the `patients` table.

Ideas to try:

- "What is the average age of patients with diabetes?"
- "Show the number of patients by condition."
- "How many female patients were admitted in February 2024?"
- "List all patients ordered from oldest to youngest."

Tips:

- Use natural language; you do **not** need to know the column names.
- If the result is not what you expected, refine your question, for example  
  "Only include patients over 50" or "group by condition".
- If you are using SQL Worksheet, try both:
  - `SELECT AI runsql 'your question here';`
  - `SELECT AI showsql 'your question here';` to see the SQL that was generated.

Congratulations!  
You've successfully used Select AI to generate and execute SQL queries for healthcare scenarios, demonstrating how it simplifies data analysis for beginners.
