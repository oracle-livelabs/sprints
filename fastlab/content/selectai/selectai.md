# How to use Select AI in Oracle Autonomous Database

Welcome to this **LiveLabs FastLab** workshop.

LiveLabs FastLab workshops give you clear, step-by-step instructions to help you quickly gain hands-on experience with the Oracle Autonomous Database. You will go from beginner to confident user in a short time.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

## FastLab Introduction

In today's data-driven world, accessing and analyzing information quickly is crucial, especially in fields like healthcare where timely insights can save lives. However, writing SQL queries requires specialized skills that not all business users possess.

**Select AI** is Oracle's generative AI feature integrated into Autonomous Database that translates natural language questions into accurate SQL queries. It democratizes data access, allowing analysts, doctors, and managers to derive insights from databases using plain English, without needing to learn complex SQL syntax.

This capability is particularly important in healthcare, where non-technical staff can query patient records, treatment outcomes, or resource allocation to support faster decision-making and improve patient care. With Select AI, you can focus on the questions that matter, while the AI handles the technical details.

In this 15-minute lab, you'll create a sample healthcare dataset and use Select AI to generate and execute queries for common business cases.

### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Autonomous Database

  - Check our [LiveLabs FastLab - Create an Autonomous Database. Fast!](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=4276)

## Task 1: Launch Database Actions and SQL Worksheet

You will use Database Actions as your workspace. This task opens the SQL Worksheet so you can run SQL commands.

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, navigate to your Autonomous Database.

2. Click **Database Actions** and select **SQL**.

## Task 2: Create a Sample Healthcare Dataset

To demonstrate Select AI, we'll create a simple `patients` table with sample data representing patient records.

1. Run the following SQL to create the table and insert data:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    -- Create patients table
    CREATE TABLE patients (
        id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR2(100),
        age NUMBER,
        gender VARCHAR2(10),
        condition VARCHAR2(100),
        admission_date DATE
    );

    -- Insert sample data
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('John Doe', 65, 'Male', 'Diabetes', DATE '2024-01-15');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Jane Smith', 72, 'Female', 'Heart Disease', DATE '2024-03-20');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Bob Johnson', 55, 'Male', 'Hypertension', DATE '2024-05-10');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Alice Brown', 68, 'Female', 'Diabetes', DATE '2024-02-05');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Charlie Wilson', 80, 'Male', 'Heart Disease', DATE '2024-06-01');
    INSERT INTO patients (name, age, gender, condition, admission_date) VALUES 
    ('Diana Davis', 45, 'Female', 'Asthma', DATE '2024-04-12');

    COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ```

2. Verify the data:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM patients;
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Access Select AI

Select AI is available through the Database Actions interface.

1. From the Autonomous Database details page, click **Database Actions**.

2. In the Launchpad, click **Select AI**.

   - If prompted, sign in with your database credentials.

3. The Select AI chat interface will open, where you can enter natural language questions.

## Task 4: Generate SQL Queries with Select AI for Healthcare Business Cases

Select AI analyzes your natural language input and generates the corresponding SQL query based on your database schema. Here are examples of healthcare-related queries.

1. **Business Case: Identify elderly patients with diabetes for follow-up care.**

   Enter in Select AI: "List all patients over 60 years old with diabetes."

   Expected generated SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE age > 60 AND condition = 'Diabetes';
   ```

   - This query would return John Doe and Alice Brown.

2. **Business Case: Analyze admissions for heart conditions in the past 6 months.**

   Enter: "How many patients were admitted in the last 6 months with heart disease?"

   Expected generated SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM patients WHERE admission_date >= ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -6) AND condition = 'Heart Disease';
   ```

   - This helps in resource planning for cardiology.

3. **Business Case: Gender distribution of patients with chronic conditions.**

   Enter: "Show the number of male and female patients with diabetes or heart disease."

   Expected generated SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM patients WHERE condition IN ('Diabetes', 'Heart Disease') GROUP BY gender;
   ```

   - Useful for demographic analysis in healthcare studies.

4. **Business Case: Recent admissions overview.**

   Enter: "List patients admitted after April 2024, sorted by admission date."

   Expected generated SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE admission_date > DATE '2024-04-01' ORDER BY admission_date;
   ```

   - Aids in tracking recent cases.

For each query, Select AI will display the generated SQL. You can review, modify if needed, and execute it.

## Task 5: Execute Generated SQL in SQL Worksheet

1. Copy the SQL from Select AI.

2. Paste and run it in the SQL Worksheet to see results.

   For example, run the first query:

   ```sql
   <copy>
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE age > 60 AND condition = 'Diabetes';
   </copy>
   ```

Congratulations!  
You've successfully used Select AI to generate and execute SQL queries for healthcare scenarios, demonstrating how it simplifies data analysis for beginners.
