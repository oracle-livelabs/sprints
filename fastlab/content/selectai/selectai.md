# Select AI in Oracle Autonomous AI Database

Welcome to this **LiveLabs FastLab** workshop.

LiveLabs FastLab workshops give you clear, step-by-step instructions to help you quickly gain hands-on experience with Oracle Autonomous AI Database. You move from beginner to confident user in a short time.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

## FastLab Introduction

Select AI in Oracle Autonomous AI Database lets you interact with your data using natural language; whether asking questions without SQL syntax or supplying text documents to improve your model’s responses. Select AI also supports chatting directly with your LLM, generating synthetic data, translating and summarizing text, and building AI agents. In this session, we focus on natural language to SQL (NL2SQL).

Many teams still rely on a few SQL experts, slowing everyday questions and decisions. Select AI removes this bottleneck by turning natural language questions into SQL based on your actual tables and views. You can review the generated SQL, run it, get step-by-step explanations, or receive a textual summary of the results.

In this FastLab, you’ll use a small dataset to ask questions in plain English, see the SQL Select AI produces, and execute it. Depending on your LLM provider, you can also ask questions in other languages. Give it a try!

### Objectives: 

* Use Select AI to query data using natural language 
* Use the Select AI demo application to chat with your data in your own language
* See and understand the SQL that Select AI generates

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following before starting:

**Select AI already configured** for your lab user; (see Labs 1–2 in the following workshop):
[Chat with Your Data in Autonomous AI Database Using Select AI](https://livelabs.oracle.com/ords/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?clear=RR,180&wid=3831&session=937205042399)


## Task 1. How to ask natural language questions
You can ask questions using Oracle's SELECT AI feature. **AI** is a special keyword in the select statement that tells the Autonomous Database that the subsequent text will be either an action or a natural language question.

Here are the actions:

    1. chat - general AI chat in natural language
    2. runsql - [default, if not action is specified] ask a question and get a structured result
    3. narrate - ask a question and get a conversational result
    4. showsql - SQL used to produce the result
    5. explainsql - an explanation of the SQL used to produce the result

## Task 2: Oracle MovieStream Business Scenario
This fastlabs's business scenario is based on Oracle MovieStream - a fictitious movie streaming service that is similar to services to which you currently subscribe. You'll be able to ask questions about movies, customers who watch movies, and the movies they decide to watch.

Here are the numerous tables included as part of the AI profile:

    movies
    streams
    customer_extension
    customer_contact
    customer_segment
    pizza_shop
    genre
    actors

Behind the scenes, Select AI uses your **AI profile** to know which tables and columns it can query.

## Task 3: Access Select AI (Chat or OML)

Pick one approach to use as you go through the examples below.

  >Note, you will need to complete the prerequisites stated above to perform the following tasks. Use this workshop to get started: [Chat with Your Data in Autonomous AI Database Using Select AI](https://livelabs.oracle.com/ords/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?clear=RR,180&wid=3831&session=937205042399)

1. **Option A – `ASK ORACLE` APEX chatbot app** 
     * Sign in with your database user credentials from the prerequisites.
     ![Navigate to Directory](./images/optiona.png )

2. **Option B – `OML Notebooks` from Oracle Machine Learning**
      * Sign in with your database user credentials from the prerequisites.
      ![Navigate to Directory](./images/optionb.png )

3. In the Ask Oracle chatbot, you have the ability to use various options for interacting with your LLM.

   * Use **narrate** if you want a conversational experience.
   * Use **explain** if you want to see the generated SQL.
   * Use **database** for all queries that relate to the `moviestream` dataset


## Task 4: Ask Questions with `Ask Oracle powered by Select AI`

In the following examples, we will ask questions about movies based on Oracle MovieStream - a fictitious movie streaming service.

For each case:

* If you use **Ask Oracle chat**, type the question into the Select AI prompt and run it.
* If you use **OML**, run:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    SELECT AI runsql 'your question here';
    </copy>
    ```

    and optionally to see the SQL:

    ```sql
    <copy>
    SELECT AI showsql 'your question here';
    </copy>
    ```

### Case 1: Total sales by movie

**Ask Oracle - Select AI**

> `What are our total sales by movie with best movies first?`

  ![Navigate to Directory](./images/task41.png)

**Example SQL generated by Select AI**
 
 >Note: Your SQL may not match the examples below exactly. It should be logically equivalent and return the same kind of result.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    SELECT 
      m."TITLE" AS "Movie Title", 
      SUM(s."SALES") AS "Total Sales"
    FROM 
      "MOVIESTREAM"."STREAMS" s
      JOIN "MOVIESTREAM"."MOVIES" m ON s."MOVIE_ID" = m."MOVIE_ID"
    GROUP BY 
      m."TITLE"
    ORDER BY 
      "Total Sales" DESC
      <copy>
    ```

Select the `Explain` or `show SQL` buttons to view the generated SQL

**Oracle SQL Query Explanation**

The provided Oracle SQL query is designed to retrieve the total sales for each movie from the "STREAMS" and "MOVIES" tables in the "MOVIESTREAM" schema.

Some things to notice when you check out the generated SQL under the `Explain` option:

* Finds tables to join
* Determines columns to query - even when the columns aren't mentioned in the query

### Case 2: Best selling movies using the `narrate` option

**Ask Oracle - Select AI**

> `What are our top 5 selling movies?`

  ![Navigate to Directory](./images/task5.png)

### Case 3: A specific movie saga

**Ask Oracle - Select AI**

> `List all spider-man movies in order of sales`

  ![Navigate to Directory](./images/task6.png)

**Example SQL generated by Select AI**

      ```sql
      <copy>
    SELECT 
      m."TITLE" AS "Movie Title", 
      SUM(s."SALES") AS "Total Sales"
    FROM 
      "MOVIESTREAM"."STREAMS" s
      JOIN "MOVIESTREAM"."MOVIES" m ON s."MOVIE_ID" = m."MOVIE_ID"
    WHERE 
      UPPER(m."TITLE") LIKE UPPER('%Spider-Man%')
    GROUP BY 
      m."TITLE"
    ORDER BY 
      "Total Sales" DESC
      <copy>
      ```

**Oracle SQL Query Explanation**

This Oracle SQL query is designed to retrieve the total sales for movies with titles containing the phrase "Spider-Man". The query joins two tables, "STREAMS" and "MOVIES", based on the "MOVIE_ID" column, and then filters the results to include only movies with titles matching the specified criteria.


## Task 5: Ask your own questions

You learn Select AI best by asking your own questions. In this task, you practice using natural language to explore the MOVIESTREAM tables without any prompts.

Ask Select AI at least ***three*** of your own questions.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

* `select ai runsql what are sales by customer segment`
* `select ai chat what are considered the best movies produced in the past 20 years`

**Congratulations!**
You have successfully completed the Oracle AI Database Select AI FastLab. 

You can now ask natural language questions against a real Oracle database, see the SQL that Select AI generates, and start turning ad hoc questions into reusable SQL for your own projects.

## Next Steps

You have now seen how Select AI turns natural language into SQL on a simple movies dataset. To build on this FastLab, consider:

* **Use Select AI on your own schema**
  Point an AI profile at a real application schema and try similar questions.

* **Combine Select AI with applications**
  Call `SELECT AI` from APEX, ORDS, or a microservice to let business users ask questions through a web UI.
