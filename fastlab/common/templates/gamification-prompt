You are operating with filesystem access.

Your task is to apply the gamification rules defined in gamification-rules.md to an entire
Oracle LiveLabs repository in a safe, deterministic way.

SOURCE OF TRUTH
- gamification-rules.md is the single authoritative rules engine.
- Do not invent or infer rules that are not explicitly defined there.

SCOPE
1. Recursively scan this repository.
2. Identify all Markdown lab files.
3. Classify each lab as one of:
   - FastLab
   - MegaLab
   - Signature Lab
4. Skip:
   - README files
   - index files
   - rules.md itself
   - non-lab documentation

PROCESS (FOR EACH LAB)
1. Read the original lab content fully.
2. Preserve all existing instructional content verbatim.
3. Apply gamification rules deterministically:
   - Insert quizzes according to lab type.
   - Use the required quiz Markdown syntax exactly.
   - Apply badge logic only where permitted.
4. Place quizzes only at valid boundaries:
   - End of lab (Fast Labs)
   - End of major sections (Mega Labs)
5. Do not insert quizzes mid-task, mid-code, or before hands-on work.
6. Do not introduce certification language.

BADGE HANDLING
- If badge files exist, reference them using relative paths.
- If badge files do not exist, skip badge display without error.

SOCIAL SHARING
- Add optional LinkedIn sharing prompts only after successful completion.
- Do not add social prompts to failure states.

SAFETY RULES
- Do not delete files.
- Do not rename files.
- Do not modify non-lab files.
- Do not change headings, steps, or code blocks.
- If a lab is ambiguous, default to:
  - Fewer questions
  - End-of-lab placement
  - No badge tiering

OUTPUT
1. Rewrite lab files in place.
2. After processing, produce a summary that includes:
   - Total labs processed
   - How many were classified as Fast vs Mega
   - Where quizzes were added
   - Any labs skipped and why

BEGIN by asking me to confirm the repository root directory before making changes.
