### **Create a Connection to a Query Service Data Source**

You can create a connection to enable you to analyze and visualize data in that data source. A dataset uses one or more connections to data sources such as Query Service to access and supply data for analysis and visualization. Create a connection to the `project` schema in Query Service.

1. From the Oracle Analytics banner, click **Create**, and then click **Connection**.  

    ![The oracle analytics create options are displayed.](./images/click-connection.png " ")

2. From the **Create Connection** dialog box, in the **Select Connection Type** region, click **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

    ![Click oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse.](./images/click-adbw.png " ")

3. In the **Create Connection** dialog box, specify the following:

    * **Name:** Enter **qs-connection**.
    * **Description:** Enter an optional description.
    * **Client Credentials:** Click **Select** and navigate to the location where you downloaded your `wallet.zip` file (contains the **`cwallet.sso`**) in the **How do I connect to Query Service from Oracle Analytics Cloud?** sprint, and select it. The **`cwallet.sso`** file is displayed in this field.
    * **Username:** Enter **project**. This is one of the schemas that is available with Query Service.
    * **Password:** Enter the database password that you created in the **How do I connect to Query Service from Oracle Analytics Cloud?** sprint.
    * **Service Name:** Accept the default value.

      ![The populated dialog box is displayed.](./images/poplulated-create-db.png " ")

4. Click **Save**. A **Connection created successfully** message is displayed.

5. To view your available connections, on **Home** page, click the **Navigation** menu, and then click **Data**. On the **Data** page, click the **Connections** tab to view your connections list.

    ![View available connections.](./images/available-connections.png " ")

### **Create a Dataset from the Query Service Connection**

Datasets are self-service data models that you build specifically for your data visualization and analysis requirements. You use visualizations and analyses to find the answers that you need from key business data displayed in graphical formats. A dataset contains data source connection information, tables, the columns you specify, and the data enrichments and transformations that you apply. Create a dataset using your new Query Service connection.

1.  From the Oracle Analytics banner, click **Create**, and then click **Dataset**.  

    ![The create list options is displayed.](./images/click-dataset.png " ")

2. In the **Create Dataset** dialog box, click the **qs-connection**.

    ![Click connection name.](./images/click-connection-name.png " ")

    The **New Dataset** page is displayed. Drill-down on the **Schemas** node in the Navigation tree on the left to display the schemas in the **project** user.

    ![Drill-down on the schema node.](./images/project-schema.png " ")

3. Drill-down on the **MOVIESTREAM_DEMO** sample schema that is available with Query Service to display its tables. You can automatically create the best visualization on the canvas based on a set of data elements. Drag-and-drop (or double-click) the **custsales** table from the Data panel onto the canvas to add it to the dataset and to automatically create a visualization on the canvas.

    ![Drag and drop the table onto the canvas.](./images/drag-drop-table.png " ")

    A quick analysis and visualization of **custsales** is displayed in graph and table formats in the data preview area.

5. In the **Save Dataset As** dialog box, enter **qs-custsales-dataset** as the name, enter an optional description, and then click **OK**.      

    The dataset name is displayed in the banner.

    ![New dataset name is displayed in the banner.](./images/new-dataset-name-displayed.png " ")  

    >**Note:** To view your available datasets, on **Home** page, click the **Navigation** menu, and then click **Data**. On the **Data** page, click the **Datasets** tab to view your datasets list.

### **Create a Workbook and Visualize the Data**

1. Click **Create Workbook** in the banner.

    ![Click create workbook.](./images/click-create-workbook.png " ")

2. Display the data for the **ACTUAL_PRICE** by **OS** columns. Drag and drop both columns onto the **Drop Visualizations or Data Here** canvas.

    ![Drag and drop tables onto canvas.](./images/drag-drop-tables.png " ")

    The Auto Visualizations bar graph for the selected actual price by OS is displayed. You can hover over any bar to display the details. You just ran analytics on top of Object Storage data!

    >**Note:** Bar graphs are one of the most commonly used visualization types. You can use them to compare data across categories, identify outliers, and uncover historical high and low data points. For other graph types, see [About Visualization Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/analytics-cloud/acubi/visualization-types.html).

    ![Tables Visualizations is displayed.](./images/visualization-displayed.png " ")

3. Save the workbook. Click the drop-down list next to the **Save** icon in the **New Workbook** banner to view the available options. Click **Save**.

    ![Save workbook options.](./images/save-workbook-options.png " ")

4. In the **Save Workbook** dialog box, enter a name and an optional description. By default, your workbook will be saved in the **My Folders** folder. To save the workbook in a new folder, click **New Folder** and follow the prompts.
