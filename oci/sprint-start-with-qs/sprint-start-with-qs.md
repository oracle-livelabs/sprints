# How do I get started with Query Service (LA)?

>**_Important:_**    
_The Query Service sprints in this series are based on the Query Service Limited Availability (LA) version._  

## About this Workshop

The sprints in the Query Service series walk you through how to access and use Query Service from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, Oracle SQL Developer, and Oracle Analytics Cloud. You will learn about the required policies that you need before you can create and use Query Server projects. You learn how to create and query Object Storage tables in Query Service using Parquet and .csv files in public and private Object Storage buckets.

Duration: 2 minutes

### What is Query Service?

Query Service is a native OCI query service that is scalable, performant, server-less, and database-less. You can use it to access Oracle Object Storage data using Oracle SQL without requiring you to create or maintain a database. You are only charged for the queries that you submit.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Create the required Query Service projects policies.
* Create a Query Service project.
* Query data using standard Oracle SQL in the Query Editor.
* Explore the project Detail page.
* Create Oracle Object Storage tables using Parquet and .csv files in Public and Private Object Storage buckets.
* Connect to Query Service from Oracle SQL Developer and optionally install SQL Developer.
* Connect to Query Service from Oracle Analytics Cloud.

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud Account
* At least one Query Service user in your tenancy. This user must be created in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM).

You may now proceed to the next lab.
