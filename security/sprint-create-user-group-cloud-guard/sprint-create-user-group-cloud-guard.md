## Creating the Cloud Guard User Group
1. First, log in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console as a tenancy administrator 
2. Open the navigation menu and click <b> Identity & Security</b>. Under <b> Identity</b>, click <b> Groups</b>.

4. Fill in the required fields and then click <b> Create</b>.
