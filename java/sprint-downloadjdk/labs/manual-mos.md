# Manually Downloading from My Oracle Support

## Introduction
[Oracle customers](https://support.oracle.com/portal/) have access to the latest stability, security, and performance updates of Oracle JDK and GraalVM as a manual download. From My Oracle Support (MOS) you can download:
- Any JDK or GraalVM release from a currently-supported release family.
- Bundled Patch Releases (BPRs). These are meant to be used only when you need a critical bug fix contained in the BPR and cannot wait for the fix to be included in a scheduled release.
- JDK and JRockit releases that have reached sustaining support, including update releases that were never offered outside of MOS.
- Current optional components, including:
    - Java SE 8 - Enterprise Performance Pack
    - TZUpdater
    - JDK Mission Control
- Legacy optional components (these are no updated or needed), such as:
    - Advanced Management Console
    - Java Access Bridge

### Licensing
Releases downloaded from My Oracle Support are not offered under the Java SE OTN, NFTC, or other public-facing licenses. They are offered under the terms of Oracle Master Agreement and related terms governing your use of MOS (such as a Java SE Subscription product or Legacy Java SE Advanced terms).

My Oracle Support also lists releases with specific restrictions, such as "Market Driven Support," which are only licensed to customers who meet those restrictions. Being able to see a release that says "restricted" does not imply that you have the right to use it; please check the terms.

If you have licensing questions please file a Non-Technical Service Request.
