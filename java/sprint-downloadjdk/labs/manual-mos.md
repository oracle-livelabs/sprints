# Manually Downloading from My Oracle Support

## Introduction
For Oracle Customers, [My Oracle Support (MOS)](https://support.oracle.com/portal/) is the recommend location for manual downloads of the Oracle JDK and GraalVM. From MOS you can download:
- Any JDK or GraalVM release from a currently-supported release family
- Bundled Patch Releases (BPRs) (These are meant to be used only when you need a critical bug fix contained in the BPR and cannot wait for it to be included in the next scheduled release)
- JDK and JRockit releases that have reached sustaining support, including update releases that were never offered outside of MOS.
- Current optional components, including:
    - Java SE 8 - Enterprise Performance Pack
    - TZUpdater
    - JDK Mission Control
- Legacy optional components (these are no updated or needed), such as:
    - Advanced Management Console
    - Java Access Bridge

### Licensing
Releases downloaded from My Oracle Support are not offered under the Java SE OTN, NFTC, or any other "public" terms. They are offered under the terms of the contract that grants customers access to MOS (such as a Java SE Subscription or Legacy Java SE Advanced terms).

My Oracle Support also lists releases with specific restrictions, such as "Market Driven Support," which are only licensed to customers who meet those restrictions. Being able to see a release that says "restricted" does not imply that you have the right to use it; please check the terms.

If you have licensing questions please file a Non-Technical Service Request.
