# Downloading the Oracle JDK
Duration: 5 minutes

## Introduction
Oracle offers multiple locations to download the Java SE Development Kit (JDK), each designed for a different use-case.

For security, we recommend only downloading the Oracle JDK from Oracle or trusted sources.


## Licenses
Java releases and Java updates are made available under different licenses. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their use of Java conforms to the applicable license.

Licenses mentioned in this workshop include:

- [Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions License (NFTC)](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/no-fee-license.html).  Subject to the conditions of the license, it permits free use for all users – even commercial and production use. Oracle offers updates to the most recent Feature Non-Long Term Support (Non LTS) releases, and the most recent Long Term Support (LTS) release, under these terms. For more information on the current licensing and frequently asked questions, please see the [Oracle Java SE Licensing FAQ](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk-faqs.html). For a detailed explanation of what happens when a new LTS supercedes an older one, please see [JDK 17 approaches end-of-permissive license](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/jdk-17-approaches-endofpermissive-license). For Roadmap information, please see the [Oracle Java SE Support Roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html).
- [Oracle Technology Network License Agreement for Oracle Java SE (OTN)](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/javase-license1.html).  This license permits personal use, development, testing, prototyping, demonstrating, and some other limited uses at no cost.  Other uses require a Java SE Subscription (or other legacy product). An easily created [Oracle account](https://profile.oracle.com/myprofile/account/create-account.jspx) or an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account is required to download any releases subject to the OTN.
- [Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products and JavaFX (BCL)](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/binary-code-license.html) was used for certain releases up to April of 2019.  No current releases are offered under these terms. 
- [The Universal Permissive License (UPL), Version 1.0](https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl/)
- [The GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)


## Oracle JDK Download Locations

The table assumes that you know what types of releases you want, but if you would like some guidance, see [Choosing the Right JDK Version: An Unofficial Guide](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/choosing-the-right-jdk-version). Oracle customers can also open a Non-Technical Service Request for assistance.
