# How do I setup the REST API connector in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)?

Duration: 3 minutes

As of the September 2022 update, Oracle Analytics allows you to create a connection to your data source using a REST API connector. This Sprint will guide you on how to set that up.

## Setup the REST API Connector

>**Note:** You must have the **BI Service Administrator** application role to complete this Sprint.

1. In your Oracle Analytics instance, click the **Navigation menu** and select **Console**.

4. You will need to sign out and sign back in to apply the change to your instance. From the homepage, click **Create** and select **Connections**. You should now see the REST API connector in the **Create Connections** menu. Select **REST API**.

5. In the next screen, enter the details of your REST API that you want to access and click **Save**. The basic information required for connecting are:

    * Base URL of the REST API
    * REST API endpoints
    * Authentication type
    * Authentication credentials

6. Once the connection has been created, you can create a dataset using the REST API connection in the normal fashion. On the homepage, click **Create** and select **Dataset**. Select the **REST API** connection we just created.

7. In the connection panel, expand the REST API connection to the **AUTOREST** schema to access the result sets of the endpoints. The RESULTS tables contain the data from the endpoints and the others contain metadata of the endpoints.
