# How do I import custom extensions/visualizations/plugins-ins in Oracle Analytics Cloud and Server (OAC & OAS)?

Duration: 2 minutes

When working with visualizations in Oracle Analytics Cloud, there are over 45 pre-built visualizations to choose from. If the visualization you need is not available, then you have the ability to import your own custom visualizations. The [Oracle Analytics Extensions Library](https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/data-visualization/extensions/) has many community developed visualizations available for download to enhance your visualizations and improve the reporting of your data.

## Import custom extensions
The following steps will guide you on how to import custom extensions.

>**Note:** You must have the **BI Service Administrator** role to be able to execute the following steps. This role allows you to work in the OAC/OAS console.

1. From the Oracle Analytics homepage **Navigation menu**, click on **Console** and select **Extensions**.
