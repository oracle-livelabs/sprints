# How do I create data actions to connect to external URLs from Visualization Canvases?

Duration: 3 minutes

When you click on a specific data column, you have the option to direct the user to an external website to provide more information about that specific column. For example, you can link a vendorâ€™s website to the vendor name column and when you right click on a visualization containing that column, you have the option to direct to the website.
