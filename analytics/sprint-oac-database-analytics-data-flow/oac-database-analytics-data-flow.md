# How do I enable the Database Analytics option within the Data Flow in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)?

Duration: 2 minutes

When working with the Data Flow in Oracle Analytics Cloud, you have the option to leverage the power of Oracle Database Analytics functions. The two database functions you have access to are Database Analytics and Graph Analytics.

* **Database Analytics**: enable you to perform advanced analysis and data mining analysis  
* **Graph Analytics**: enable you to perform geo-spatial analysis

Data Flow is a lightweight, simple and easy to use tool for business users to combine, organize, integrate and produce a curated dataset. Data Flow is an important enabler of a self-service analytics environment.

If you are working with a dataset in Data Flow and you are not seeing the Database Analytics and Graph Analytics options, the following steps will show you how to troubleshoot this.
