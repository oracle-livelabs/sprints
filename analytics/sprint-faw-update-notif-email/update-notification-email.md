# How do I update the notification email for Fusion Analytics Warehouse (FAW)?
Duration: 1 minute

When you update your notification email for Fusion Analytics Warehouse, we recommend that you provide a mailing list instead of a single individual's email address. The reason for this is risk mitigation. If the one person who was listed to receive email notifications about system maintenance is on leave during the time emails are sent out, then you risk not being able to attend to critical system maintenance tasks.

## Update notification email

1. Sign in to your [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console](https://cloud.oracle.com/).
