# How do I share a workbook in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)?

Duration: 2 minutes

Oracle Analytics gives you the ability to share your workbook with others to facilitate collaboration. When you share workbooks, you have the option to provide Edit and View privileges to users.
* **Edit** allows users to edit the workbook and make changes
* **View** limits users to only view the workbook without having the permission to edit the workbook

Sharing workbooks is a great way to collaborate without having to export your whole workbook, move it around, and risk having misaligned versions from sending it back and forth between multiple users.

## Share a workbook
You must have **BI Content Author** application role to be able to execute the following steps:

1. On your **Homepage**, click on the **Navigation menu** and click on **Catalog**. Then click on **Shared Folders**. This is where you will place your workbooks to be shared with other users within your organization.

6. Click **Share** and in the search bar, search for the user or role you want to share this folder with.

    >**Note:** As a best practice, you should share workbooks with application Roles instead of individual Users in case that user leaves your organization.

7. Once you select the User or Role, grant access priviliges by deciding whether you want the User or Role to be able to Edit or View. When finished, click **Save**. Users will now be able to access the shared workbook from their catalog!
