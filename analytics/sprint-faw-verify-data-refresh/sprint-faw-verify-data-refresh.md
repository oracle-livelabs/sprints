# How do I verify that the data refresh schedule has been completed in Fusion Analytics Warehouse (FAW)?

Duration: 4 minutes

If you have set up a Data Refresh Schedule for incremental updates in the Pipeline Parameters of your FAW instance, you may have noticed that incremental updates are not recorded in the Request History.

### What are Pipeline Parameters?
When you extract your data in FAW, you have the option to set certain specifications about the data that you are extracting within your data pipeline and this is referred to as Pipeline Parameters. Options include Analytics Language, Currency, Exchange Rate Type, and Data Refresh Schedule among others.

System Administrators will have set a Data Refresh Schedule which automatically loads  data at a time specified to ensure that their data is up-to-date.

### Why do I need to verify that the data refresh has run successfully?
* Verify that your critical records have been imported as scheduled
* Sanity check to make sure your system is running as you've specified
* Ensure that your data is current

## Verify data refresh
The following steps will guide you to verify that the incremental updates have started and been completed in your FAW environment.
