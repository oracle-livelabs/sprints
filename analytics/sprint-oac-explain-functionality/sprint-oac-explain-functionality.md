# How do I use the Explain functionality in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)?
Duration: 3 minutes

The Explain functionality of OAC is a powerful tool that uses machine learning
to uncover insights about variables of interest in your data. These findings can be added to
your workbook with the click of a button, greatly accelerating the rate at which you can
learn about your data and visualize your findings. Explain is a tool that users
of all skill levels can leverage.

## Using Explain on your Data.
>**Note:** You must have the **DV Content Author** role in order to complete the following steps.


1. From your OAC homepage create a workbook by clicking on **Create** then **Workbook**. If
you have already created a workbook that you would like to use, you can optionally open it
from the homepage and skip to step 3.

you would like to have explained, right click on it and choose **Explain**

4. The Explain feature presents you with information about your variable divided up into four sections.
These sections are **Basic Facts**, **Key Drivers**, **Segments**, and **Anomalies**. Click on each section to view its insights. You may note that all four of these sections do not appear for the variable that you chose to explain. This may be because the **Segments** section only appears for variables that are attributes, and the **Anomalies** section only appears for  variables that are measures or attributes and use the **sum** or **count** aggregation methods. There are also some variables that will show no results for Explain, such as attributes that have 100 or more unique values.

5. If you find any of the visualizations created by Explain insightful, you can add them to your canvas by clicking the
check mark in their top right corner, then choosing **Add Selected**
