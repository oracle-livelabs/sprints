When working with Oracle Analytics Cloud, you can leverage the platform's scalability. For this, you will need access to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. 

The OCI Console is where you can accomplish most administrative tasks for OAC. You can access services and update instance details using the Console, API, or command line. In this document, we'll be using the OCI Console.
