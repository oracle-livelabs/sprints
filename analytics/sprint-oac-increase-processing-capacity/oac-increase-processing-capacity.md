## How do I increase the processing capacity of my Oracle Analytics (OAC) ?

Duration: 1 minute

You can access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console to scale your Oracle Analytics Cloud instance.

You can use the OCI Console to perform many of your OAC instance administration tasks. You can access services and update instance details by using the Console, API, or command line. In this sprint you'll learn how to use the OCI Console.
