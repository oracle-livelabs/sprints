Duration: 1 minute

There may be scenarios when you want to schedule an available update earlier than the predefined date. You can change the schedule of any application update from the Release Updates tile in the administration console.

3. If there are multiple releases listed, select the release you would like to update and choose a date for the update. Then click **Save**.
    >**Note:** Release updates are cumulative, meaning that if you have many releases that you haven't applied, they get rolled into one update.
