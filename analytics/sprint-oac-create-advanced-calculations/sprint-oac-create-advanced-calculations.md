# How do I create advanced calculations in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)?
Duration: 3 minutes

Creating advanced calculations can be an effective tool to quickly populate visualizations. When creating visualizations, automated calculations can be quickly saved for later repurposing.  As of May 2022, OAC allows for powerful slice and dice analysis with any measure using these calculated objects.

## Advanced Calculations

>**Note:** You must have the **DV Content Author** application role to execute the following steps.

### Manually Customize
Advanced calculations can be quickly defined, using a customizable script.

1. Open your OAC Workbook. 

2. Notice the **My Calculations** folder on the left hand side of the display and right click the folder to select **Add Calculation**.

3. The calculation page will open with options to name the calculation, type the calculation, and validate before saving. This can be used to help populate your visualizations.

4. On this page, you will be able to give your calculation a title and type out variables, which will auto-populate according to your variables in the dataset. Function operators are available to the right side of the window. After your function is complete, be sure to **Validate** that your function works by clicking the button.

5. After a successful validation, the screen will provide a green code response next to the button. You can now click **Save** to generate your new calculation.

6. The new calculation will be generated in the window for you to use on visualizations.

### Auto Generate Calculations

Another way to populate the calculation page is by predefining clusters or outliers in your data and right-click-save in **My Calculations** folder. 

>**Note:** This procedure is only available of OAC version May 2022 or newer. OAS updates happen annually, while OAC updates are more frequent. Therefore, in order to implement this automation, you need to ensure that the OAS version postdates May 2022.

1. With the OAC notebook still open, populate a visualization.

2. Right-click the image and select add statistics, selecting **Clusters or Outliers**.

3. Right-click the populated statistics and select **Add to My Calculations**

4. Notice that the calculation was added to the may calculations folder on the left hand side. More information and edits can be made to this algorithm by right-clicking and selecting **Edit Calculation**.

5. This will open the advanced calculation window, which shows the algorithm used to create the clustering or outlier differentiation. Save and exit. You can now create new visualizations and populate images using this predefined calculation.
