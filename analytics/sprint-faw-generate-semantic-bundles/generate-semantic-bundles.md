# How do I create and deploy semantic model bundles in Fusion Analytics Warehouse (FAW)?
Duration: 4 minutes

There may be scenarios where you want to back up or migrate semantic model extensions between Fusion Analytic Warehouse instances.  A semantic model bundle allows you to bundle extensions where they have been tagged as part of the main branch or are defined in branches that are yet to be merged into the main branch.  These can be exported and then deployed across different FAW instances.

## Create and deploy semantic bundles

>**Note:** You must have the **Service Administrator** role to successfully complete this Sprint.

1. In your Fusion Analytics Warehouse instance, click the **Navigation** menu and select **Console**.

4. Enter a name and a description for the bundle.

5. It is possible to include all semantic extensions, or you can select specific tags or branches to include in the bundle. To include ALL semantic extensions in the bundle, select **Include all semantic extensions**. This removes the options to select specific tags or branches as these will all be included automatically in the semantic extension bundle.

6. To include all security configurations as part of the semantic extensions bundle, which includes the definitions of any duty or data roles defined in semantic extensions, select **Include security configurations**.

7. To include a specific branch or tag in the semantic model extension bundle, you can select the branch or tag from the drop down list. Once selected, the branch or tag and any dependencies are automatically selected under the Main Branch Tags section or the Customizations Branches section.

18. To migrate the semantic model to another environment, select the **Action** button and choose **Export**.

  ![Export bundle](images/exportbundle.png)

19. Click **import** to import the previously exported semantic extension bundle to the new environment.

  ![import bundle](images/importbundle.png)

20. Drag the semantic extension bundle file from the local directory and click **Import**.
